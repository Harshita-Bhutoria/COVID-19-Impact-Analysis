# Global COVID-19 Impact: Trends, Insights, and Analysis

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes the global impact of COVID-19, providing insights into confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths from January 22, 2020, to May 29, 2021. The analysis is presented through interactive dashboards built using Power BI, enabling users to explore key trends, metrics, and recovery rates across countries and continents.

## Tools and Technologies Used  
1. **Python (Pandas)**  
   - Preprocessed the dataset, to make it suitable for analysis.  
2. **Power BI Desktop**  
   - Built comprehensive dashboards with interactive visualizations for analyzing confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, and recovery rates.  
3. **Power Query**  
   - Used for additional data transformations, such as merging datasets and filtering records.

## Key Features of the Dashboards  
1. **Global Overview**  
   - Interactive map showcasing confirmed cases per country.  
   - Filters to explore data by date range and specific countries or regions.  
2. **Detailed Metrics**  
   - Total Confirmed Cases, Total Recoveries, Total Deaths, Recovery Rates, and Mortality Rates presented in real time.  
   - Top 5 countries with the most recoveries.  
3. **Trends Over Time**  
   - Line charts showing trends in confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths over the specified period.  
4. **Recovery Rates by Country**  
   - Table displaying country-level metrics, including recovery and mortality rates.  
5. **Interactive Buttons**  
   - Custom buttons for navigation between dashboards (e.g., "Confirmed," "Deaths," and "Recovered").

## How to Use the Dashboards  
1. Open the Power BI file (`.pbix`) using Power BI Desktop.  
2. Explore the tabs for detailed insights:  
   - **Total Confirmed Cases**  
   - **Total Deaths**  
   - **Total Recovered**  
   - **Summary**  
3. Use slicers and filters to narrow down the analysis by date range or country/region.  
4. Interact with visualizations for dynamic insights.

## Insights and Conclusions  
1. The United States, India, and Brazil reported the highest confirmed cases and recoveries.  
2. Recovery rates vary significantly across countries, with some exceeding 90%, such as Uzbekistan and Ghana.  
3. Deaths and mortality rates are concentrated in specific regions, reflecting disparities in healthcare infrastructure and pandemic response.  
4. Global trends reveal a steady rise in confirmed cases and recoveries over time, with deaths increasing at a slower rate.
